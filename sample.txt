Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Hey, whatcha watching? No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

Shut up and take my money!
What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!
That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
What kind of a father would I be if I said no? I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.
